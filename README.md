### --- d-v-b (Davis Bennett) ---

I am a data engineer with a background in bioimaging. I work with the [Cellmap Project Team](https://4dcpjanelia.org/node/68) at [Janelia Research Campus](https://www.janelia.org/) to move big imaging datasets around. 

Before getting into software development I completed a [Ph.D.](https://www.proquest.com/openview/11e1f4d305f8c0a499b5383d86537f87/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y) in biology, which required processing big microscopy datasets and gave me formative exposure to chunked array formats and distributed computing.

When I'm not working on Cellmap-specific projects, I try to help out with open source projects, namely [zarr](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python).
