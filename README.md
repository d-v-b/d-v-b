### --- d-v-b (Davis Bennett) ---

I am an independent software developer specializing in tools for processing large imaging datasets. Before becoming an independent developer, I was part of the [Cellmap Project Team](https://4dcpjanelia.org/node/68) at [Janelia Research Campus](https://www.janelia.org/). Check out some of the amazing images they produce over at [OpenOrganelle](https://www.openorganelle.org).

Before getting into software development I completed a [Ph.D. in biology](https://www.proquest.com/openview/11e1f4d305f8c0a499b5383d86537f87/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y), which involved some big microscopy datasets and gave me formative exposure to chunked array formats and distributed computing.

I also work on community projects, namely [zarr](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python).
